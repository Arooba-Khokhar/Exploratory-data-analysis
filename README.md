# Exploratory-data-analysis

In preparation to the virtual meeting we think it is best to understand your skill set with a small data analysis challenge. Please find attached data from a single patient with Parkinson's disease who wore an inertial measurement unit for several days on the lower back. An in-house algorithm was used to detect axial turns throughout the day (see time stamp last column) and quantified 8 different parameters:

Direction of turns left/right, Duration of turns in sec, Angular velocity of turns: degree/sec, Peak angular velocity, Start angular velocity within the first part of the turn, End angular velocity (end part), Middle angular velocity (middle part).

The individual tabs in the excel spreadsheet correspond to individual days.

In an ideal world we would like you to provide an exploratory data analysis including but not limited to visualization, data quality checks, descriptive statistics and potential future analysis ideas (if you had e.g. 30 subjects).
